Project for my NYU ITP Introduction to Computational Media/Nature of Code classes.

Intended to create the building blocks for a system of people with randomly generated
characteristics who age, breed, pass along genetic information to offspring, and
interact with their environments, religious traits, and governments/cultures.

Coded in Processing.  Run "genetic_crossing_toxiclibs.pde" in Processing to view the sketch.
